# Lockboxes Problem

You have **n** number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from **0** to **n - 1** and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

The function determines if all the boxes can be opened. If all boxes can be opened returns **True**, otherwise **False**.

* Boxes is a list of lists
* A key with the same number as a box opens that box
